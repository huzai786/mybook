i used to add references of websites having tons of information related to cyber security in a cherry tree database, and had to back it up on the google drive often, something it got corrupted, so I though why not make it public so others can benefit from it, from now on i'll be adding cool knowledge and tools websites, that i find during my study in cyber security.
